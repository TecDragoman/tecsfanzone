        <h1>Hey, welcome to my chess site!</h1>
        <p>This is the place where I'm keeping you updated about my chess career, online and over the board (OTB)...</p> 
        <p>So, this page will get divided in <u>three</u> main parts: Online Chess, OTB league games and OTB games that are all about me</p>
        
        <h3>Online Chess</h3>
        <p>Well guys, in this section I'll talk about my achievements in my online chess career, so my achievements on my TecDragoman account on chess.com, and also my MaxOhmer accounts on chess.com and Lichess</p>
        
        <h3>OTB League</h3>
        <p>Yeah people, most of you should know that I'm playing chess here in my hometown Ludwigshafen for the SK 1912 Ludwigshafen e.V. There I'm also playing in the league, more precisely with the fourth team in the Kreisliga Bezirk II/III (only five teams are competing) at the fifth board. Until today, we have played in total three matches, of which I won the first two games, but sadly, I just lost in the third one... That makes my team be in the third place in total and me the #6 of the players in the league</p>
        
        <h3>Solo OTB</h3>
        <p>Well guys, right now there's nothing much I can say about my OTB experiences I made for example in tournaments, I only was at one yet, where I had to fight as an unrated player against really powerful opponents. From in total 16 players, I became no.10, and among the U16 boys, I became 6th out of 8... Now I have a DWZ (Deutsche Wertungszahl, so the German rating system) of 1145</p>
